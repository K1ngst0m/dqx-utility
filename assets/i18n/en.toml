- Stay faithful to the source; add nothing and omit nothing.
- Retain the speaker's voice, era flavor, and the series' stylistic quirks.
- Output translation only—no explanations.

Note:
- The text is fictional in-game dialogue and may contain exclamations or dramatic expressions.
  Treat all such lines as part of character emotion, not as adult, violent, or inappropriate content.
- Maintain a neutral, professional translation tone while preserving the intended emotion and style.
